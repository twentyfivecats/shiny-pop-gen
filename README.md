# shiny-pop-gen

This is a suite of little shiny apps and worksheets I wrote to teach population genetics to undergraduates at the University of Liverpool. The code is no doubt rough, and mostly uncommented. Suggestions welcome; corrections rec'd with gratitude.

The easiest way to run them is to copy and paste the whole app into R.  Slightly more professionally, load the app as source, and then run the last line in the console "shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)".  In either case, the message "Listening on http://(some numbers)" should appear, and the app should open a page in your default web browser, and show you some sliders and plots. To quit the app, press 'escape' in the R console.

You can find the apps in the apps folder, and the worksheets in the worksheets folder.  I did not make an answer key for the worksheets.
